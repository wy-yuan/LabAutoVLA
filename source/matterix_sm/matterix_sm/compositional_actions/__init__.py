"""Compositional actions for the state machine.

This module provides high-level actions composed of primitive actions:
- CompositionalAction: Base class for all compositional actions
- PickObject: Pick an object using frame-based manipulation

Each compositional action is paired with its configuration class
(e.g., PickObject + PickObjectCfg).
